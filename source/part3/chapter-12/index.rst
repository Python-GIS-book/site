12. Watershed analysis
======================

Chapter 12 focuses on a case study related to watersheds. Watershed analysis is the process of analyzing the landscape and hydrology of watersheds, i.e. land areas where surface water drains to a common outlet, such as a river, lake, or ocean. In our case we aim to understand how factors (e.g. the area or topographic relief) vary within a set of river watersheds. By doing this we are able to explore relationships related to landscape uplift and erosion.
