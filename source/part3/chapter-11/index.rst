11. Spatial accessibility modelling
===================================

Chapter 11 focuses on spatial accessibility as a concept to understand how easily different places in a city can be accessed by different travel modes and
how we can use accessibility as a conceptual tool to understand the landscape of opportunities in a given area. We will learn how to calculate travel times
matrices by different travel modes (public transport, car, bike, walking) which is essential information for accessibility analysis.
