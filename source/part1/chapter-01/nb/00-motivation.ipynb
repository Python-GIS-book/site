    "2. Keeping a log of the changes you make to your programs\n",

    "One of the things we will learn in this part of the book is how to use Python to plot data. As you well know, the raw data alone are often not particularly useful in helping you understand what the data show. Let's look at an example that might be familiar to you, global temperature data. The first ten lines of a climate data file can be found below.\n",

This example is obviously much better than the raw text data, nicely showing how temperatures have changed with time and how global temperatures have increased significantly since 1970. Now we have taken a clear step toward making the data easier to understand. However, these are global data and we are missing something important about them, their connection to geographical locations."

Not only do we see the changes in temperature, but now we see how temperatures vary in space across the globe. The drawback here is that we only see a single time snapshot, rather than a time series. Seeing both will require a truly remarkable visualization."

We have essentially the same data that were plotted in Figures 1.1 and 1.2, but now we can see how temperatures vary in both space and time. An [animated \"pill packet\" plot]((https://flic.kr/p/293M1oa)) of temperature anomalies (Figure 1.3) conveys a huge amount of information in a simple form. People can immediately understand what is plotted, and the combination of the plot format, colors and animation are very effective.
