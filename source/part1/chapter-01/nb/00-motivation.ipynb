    "The goal of the first part of this book is to learn to program in Python. However, in addition to learning to program, we hope to help you learn a number of other skills related to open science. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Writing programs that are easy to understand and share\n",
    "2. Keeping a log of the changes you make to your programs\n",
    "3. Creating programs that ensure your science is reproducible\n",
    "4. Producing simple, effective data visualizations that make your results accessible and easy to understand\n",

    "One of the things we will learn in this part of the book is how to use Python to plot data. As you well know, the raw data alone are often not particularly useful in helping you understand what the data show. Let's look at an example that might be familiar to you, global temperature data. The first ten lines of a climate data file can be found below.\n",
