    "data analysis in Python. It is a mature data analytics framework that is widely used among different fields of science, thus there exists a lot of good examples and documentation that can help you get going with your data analysis tasks. The development of pandas started in 2008 and it is now maintained by an active developer community ({cite}`McKinney2017`).\n",

    "## Pandas data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, table-like data are stored in two-dimensional `DataFrame` with labeled rows and columns. You can think of the pandas DataFrame as a programmable spreadsheet. The pandas DataFrame was originally inspired by dataframes that are in-built in the R programming language. One-dimensional sequences of values are stored in pandas `Series`. One row or one column in a pandas DataFrame is actually a pandas Series. You can think of a pandas Series as a clever list. These pandas structures incorporate a number of things we've already encountered, such as indices, data stored in a collection, and data types.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, both the DataFrame and Series in pandas have an index that can be used to select values, but they also have column labels to identify columns in DataFrames. In the next sections, we will use many of these features to explore real-world data and learn some useful data analysis procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a comprehensive overview of pandas data structures, we recommend you to have a look at pandas online documentation about data structures [^urlds] as well as Chapter 5 in {cite}`McKinney2017`."

    "It is quite common to have some other character instead of comma separating the columns from each other. The `read_csv()` is a generic function for reading text-based data files, supporting files separated by commas, spaces, or other common separators. The `sep` parameter can be used to specify which character is used as a delimiter. For instance `sep=';'`, would assume that the columns in the data file are delimited with semicolon (`;`). For a full list of available parameters, please refer to the pandas documentation for pandas.read_csv [^urlreadcsv], or run `help(pd.read_csv)`. Pandas has also several functions for parsing input data from different formats. For example, reading Excel files can be easily done by using a function `read_excel()`. Another useful function is `read_pickle()` that reads data stored in the Python pickle format.
