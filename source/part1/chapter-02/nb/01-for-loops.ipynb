    "\n",
    "Good question. There are two common case where you might need to loop using index values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you want to update individual values in a list you're likely going to need a loop that includes the index values. To update a list value, you need to refer to both the list and index, which means looping using the list values directly will not work. There are functions such as `enumerate()` that can help, but their use can be somewhat confusing for new programmers.\n",
    "2. In cases where you have multiple lists that are related to one another, it can be handy to use a loop with the index values to be able to access corresponding locations in each list. For this, let's consider an example with the two lists below."

We'll get more practice with this kind of thing in the exercises for this week. In the example above, we used the length of the list `cities` in the `range()` function. We could just as easily used the list `countries` to define the values of `i` since both lists are the same length."
