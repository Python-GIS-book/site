    "The [`pandas` Python library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) [^pandas] is an easy-to-use, powerful data analysis toolkit. It is a mature data analytics framework that is widely used in different fields of science. The development of `pandas` started in 2008 and it is now maintained by an active developer community ({cite}`McKinney2022`).\n",
    "\n",
    "`pandas` is a \"high-level\" package, which means that it makes use of several other packages in the background. It combines the performance of powerful Python libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) [^numpy], [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) [^matplotlib], and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) [^scipy].\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful features of `pandas` is its ability to interact with numerous data formats. It supports reading and writing data from/to formats including\n",

    "In `pandas`, table-like data are stored in two-dimensional `DataFrame` objects with labeled rows and columns. The `pandas` `DataFrame` was originally inspired by data frames that are in the R programming language. You can think of a `DataFrame` in `pandas` as a programmable spreadsheet. One-dimensional sequences of values are stored as a `pandas` `Series`. A single row or column in a `pandas` `DataFrame` is actually a `pandas` `Series`. You can think of a `pandas` `Series` as a clever list. These `pandas` structures incorporate a number of things we've already encountered earlier in this book, such as indices, data stored in a collection, and data types.\n",

For a comprehensive overview of `pandas` data structures, we recommend you have a look at the [`pandas` online documentation about data structures](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html) [^pandas_ds] as well as Chapter 5 in {cite}`McKinney2022`."

    "Let's check the the contents of our data. You can print the contents of a `DataFrame` (or a snippet of it) simply by calling it by name (e.g., `data`). However, quite often you want to check only a selection of *n* rows from the start or end of the data set. For doing that, we can use the `.head()` method of the `DataFrame` object that will, by default, return the first five rows of the `DataFrame`. You can return any number of rows by adding that number inside the parentheses. For example, `data.head(10)` would return the first ten rows from the `DataFrame` called `data`."
