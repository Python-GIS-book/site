    "\n",
    "By looking at the data, we can see a few things that we need to consider when reading the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The delimiter: The columns are separated with a varying amount of spaces which requires using some special tricks when reading the data with pandas `read_csv()` function\n",
    "2. NoData values: `NaN` values in the NOAA data are coded with varying number of `*` characters and hence we need to be able to instruct pandas to interpret those as `NaN`. \n",
    "3. Many columns: The input data contains many columns (33 in total). Many of those do not contain data we need. Thus, we should probably ignore the unnecessary columns already at this stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Handling and cleaning heterogeneous input data (such as in our example here) can be done after reading in the data. However, in many cases it is actually useful to do some cleaning and preprocessing when reading in the data. In fact, it is often much easier to do things this way. For our data file, we can read the data with varying number of spaces between the columns (point 1 above) by using the parameter `sep=r\"\\s+\"`. In this case, we use a raw text string with the `sep` parameter, which is indicated by the `r` before the first quotation mark and ensures the escape character `\\` is handled properly in the `sep` string. For handling the NoData values (point 2 above), we can tell `pandas` to consider the `*` characters as `NaN` by using the parameter `na_values` and specifying a list of characters that should be converted to `NaN`. For this data file we can specify `na_values=['*', '**', '***', '****', '*****', '******']`, which will then convert the varying number of `*` characters into `NaN` values. Finally, we can limit the number of columns that we read (point 3 above) by using the `usecols` parameter, which we have already used previously. In our case, we are interested in columns that might be somehow useful to our analysis, including the station name, timestamp, and data about temperatures: `'USAF', 'YR--MODAHRMN', 'TEMP', 'MAX', 'MIN'`. Achieving all these things is pretty straightforward using the `read_csv()` function, as demonstrated below."

In order to change the column names, we need to tell pandas how we want to rename the columns using a dictionary that converts the old names to new ones.

Please note that iterating over rows this way is a rather inefficient approach, but it is still useful to understand the logic behind how this works. When using the `iterrows()` method it is important to understand that `iterrows()` accesses not only the values of one row, but also the `index` of the row. Let's start with a simple example `for` loop that goes through each row in our DataFrame."

Also, notice that when developing a for loop you do not always need to iterate through the entire loop if you just want to test things out. Using the `break` statement in Python terminates a loop whenever it is placed inside the loop. Here we used it to check out the values on the first row of the DataFrame. This allows us to test the code logic without printing thousands of values to the screen!\n",

    "Next, let's create an empty column `TEMP_C` for the Celsius temperatures and update the values in that column using the `fahr_to_celsius()` function that we defined earlier. For updating the value in the DataFrame, we can use the `at` method that we already used earlier in this chapter. This time, however, we will use the `itertuples()` method to access the rows in the DataFrame. The `itertuples()` method works similarly to `iterrows()`, except it returns only the row values without the `index`. In addition,  the returned values are not a pandas Series, but instead `itertuples()` returns a named tuple data type. As a result, when using `itertuples()` accessing the row values needs to be done a bit differently. Remember, a {term}`tuple` is like a list but {term}`immutable` and a \"named tuple\" is a special kind of tuple object that adds the ability to access the values by name instead of position index. Hence, we can access the `TEMP_F` value in a given row using `row.TEMP_F` (in contrast to how we accessed the value in the previous code above). We will not work with named tuples in the rest of the book, but more information can be found in the Python documentation for named tuples [^namedtuple].\n",

Because the `apply()` method will execute and use the function itself in the background when it operates with the data. If we would pass our function with the parentheses, the `fahr_to_celsius()` function would actually be executed once before the loop with `apply()` starts (hence becoming unusable), and that is not what we want.
