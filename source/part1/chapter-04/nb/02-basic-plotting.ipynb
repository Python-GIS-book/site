Now, we will wade into visualizing our data in more detail, starting by using the built-in plotting options available directly in pandas. Much like the case of pandas being built upon numpy, plotting in pandas takes advantage of plotting features from the `matplotlib` [^matplotlib] plotting library. Plotting in pandas provides a basic framework for quickly visualizing our data, but as you'll see we will need to also use features from matplotlib for more advanced formatting and to enhance our plots. In particular, we will use features from the the `pyplot` [^pyplot] module in matplotlib, which provides MATLAB-like [^matlab] plotting. We will also briefly explore creating interactive plots using the `hvplot` [^hvplot] plotting library, which allows us to produce plots similar to those available in the `bokeh` plotting library [^bokeh] using plotting syntax very similar to that in pandas."

    "We have seen in the previous parts of this chapter that there are many ways to configure and visualize data using Python. Up to this point, however, we have focussed on static visualizations in Jupyter notebooks or those saved as images. As you might imagine, there are numerous Python options to also create interactive visualizations that allow those viewing them to dive deeper into the data and explore. Interactive visualizations are increasingly popular online, and here we provide a brief example of how to create an interactive visualization using the data we have already plotted above. In this example, we will be using the hvPlot library [^hvplot], which we will return to using later in Part 2 of this book.\n",

    "hvPlot is a high-level plotting package that can accept several different common Python data types and plot them using using the bokeh visualization library [^bokeh]. The great thing with hvPlot is that it takes almost no effort to move from plotting in pandas to creating interactive plots. We can explore this in the following example.\n",
