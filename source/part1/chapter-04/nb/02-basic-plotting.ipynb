    "As we're now familiar with some of the features of pandas, we will wade into visualizing our data in Python using the built-in plotting options available directly in pandas. Much like the case of pandas being built upon numpy, plotting in pandas takes advantage of plotting features from the `matplotlib` [^matplotlib] plotting library. Plotting in pandas provides a basic framework for visualizing our data, but as you'll see we will sometimes need to also use features from matplotlib to enhance our plots. In particular, we will use features from the the `pyplot` [^pyplot] module in matplotlib, which provides MATLAB-like plotting. We will also briefly explore creating interactive plots using the `pandas-bokeh` [^pandas_bokeh] plotting backend, which allows us to produce plots similar to those available in the `bokeh` plotting library [^bokeh] using plotting syntax similar to that used normally in pandas."
