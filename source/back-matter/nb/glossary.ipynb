    "Tuple\n",
    "  A [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences) is a Python data structure that consists of a number of values separated by commas. Coordinate pairs are often represented as a tuple, such as: `(60.192059, 24.945831)`. Tuples belong to [sequence data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq) in Python. Other sequence data types are lists and ranges. Tuples have many similarities with lists and ranges, but they are often used for different purposes. The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are [immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable), which means that the contents of a tuple cannot be altered (while lists are mutable; you can, for example, add and remove values from lists).\n",

    "Type conversion\n",
    "  Changing the data type of a Python object. For example, `float(5)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unary union\n",
    "  The unary union operation takes multiple geometries and merges them into a single geometry. This is useful when you have a collection of shapes and you want to treat them as a single entity for analysis or visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsigned integer\n",
    "  A type of integer that represents only non-negative whole numbers, starting from zero. Unlike {term}`signed integers`, unsigned integers do not include a \"+\" or \"-\" sign, allowing them to use all their bits for positive values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable\n",
    "  A way of storing values in the memory of the computer using specific names that you define.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version\n",
    "  A specific instance of changes to files in a {term}`repository` of a {term}`version control` system. Also referred to as a {term}`revision`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control\n",
    "  The practice of tracking changes to computer files, typically {term}`source code` files for {term}`computer programs <Program>`. Version control allows users to easily collaborate and revert to previous versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual environment\n",
    "  A virtual environment is a Python programming environment which works in a way that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from the ones installed in other virtual environments, as well as from (possible) system Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watershed\n",
    "  An area of land where all surface water drains to a common outlet, such as a river, lake, or ocean.\n",

    "Well-known binary\n",
    "  Well-known binary (WKB) is a format for representing vector geometry objects in compressed binary format which is useful for computer processing. The human-readable equivalent for WKB is `Well-known text` format. WKB can represent various geometric objects: Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString, Polygon, MultiPolygon, Triangle, PolyhedralSurface, TIN (Triangulated irregular network) and GeometryCollection. Coordinates for the geometries can be represented in 2D, 3D or 4D (x,y,z,m).\n",
