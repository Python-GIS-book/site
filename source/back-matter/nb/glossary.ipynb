    "Docstring\n",
    "  A text string used to document a section of code.\n",
    "  Docstrings are frequently used for functions to describe what the function does as well as providing information about input parameters and function outputs.\n",
    "  You are encouraged to create docstrings when making functions as they can be used with the Python help function to show users how functions work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function\n",
    "  A reusable piece of code that performs a single action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "  A web application that allows users to combine rich-formtted text with code cells in an interactive document.\n",
    "  Jupyter Notebooks can contain nicely formatted text, equations, images, interactive visualizations, and more.\n",
    "  More information can be found at <https://jupyter.org/>.\n",

    "Markdown\n",
    "  A lightweight markup language used to convert plain text input to rich-formatted output.\n",
    "  Markdown can, for example, be used to create simple documentation with different heading levels, text in bold and/or italics, text in lists, or documentation that includes hyperlinks.\n",
    "  More information can be found at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Module\n",
    "  A file containing Python definitions and statements. Module files have the ``.py`` file extension.\n",
