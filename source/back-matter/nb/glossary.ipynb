    "Coordinate Reference System\n",
    "  A coordinate reference system (CRS) described how the coordinates or geometries are related to the places on Earth. It typically includes a set of geographic or projected coordinates and a mathematical model that describes the shape of the Earth and the relationship between the coordinates and their positions on the Earth's surface.

    "Data model\n",
    "  A data model is an conceptual (abstract) model that shows how elements of data are organized and how they relate to one another in a standardized manner and how the data relate to properties of real-world entities.

    "Decimal degrees\n",
    "  A decimal degree is a method of expressing latitude and longitude geographic coordinates as decimal fractions instead of degrees, minutes, and seconds. It represents the angle between a point on the earth's surface and the equator or prime meridian, respectively, in units of decimal degrees.

    "KD-Tree\n",
    "  A KD-Tree, or K-dimensional tree, is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. KD-Trees are useful for making specific search tasks faster and more efficient, such as nearest neighbor search. The structure recursively divides the space into two half-spaces at each level, using one dimension at each step. This division is typically done by selecting a median value along one dimension to split the dataset, creating a binary tree. KD-Trees enable efficient querying of the space, such as finding points within a given range or nearest to a specific point, by significantly reducing the number of comparisons needed to locate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest Neighbor search\n",
    "  K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) search is a type of algorithm used to find the \"k\" closest points (or neighbors) to a given query point in a dataset. In the context of spatial data, KNN search can identify the nearest geographical features based on their spatial coordinates. The algorithm calculates distances between the query point and all points in the dataset, then selects the \"k\" smallest distances to determine the nearest neighbors. \n",

    "\n",
    "Spatial index\n",
    "  A spatial index is a data structure designed to efficiently query spatial data, such as Points, LineStrings and Polygons within a multidimensional space.

Other sequence data types are lists and ranges. Tuples have many similarities with lists and ranges, but they are often used for different purposes. The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are [immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable), which means that the contents of a tuple cannot be altered (while lists are mutable; you can, for example, add and remove values from lists).\n",
