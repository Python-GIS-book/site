    "  \n",
    "Coordinate Reference System\n",
    "  A coordinate reference system (CRS) described how the coordinates or geometries are related to the places on Earth. It typically includes a set of geographic or projected coordinates and a mathematical model that describes the shape of the Earth and the relationship between the coordinates and their positions on the Earth's surface. A CRS is used to locate positions accurately and to enable the exchange of geographic data between different systems and applications.\n",

    "Coordinate transformation\n",
    "  See {term}`Map reprojection.`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Data model\n",
    "  A data model is an conceptual (abstract) model that shows how elements of data are organized and how they relate to one another in a standardized manner and how the data relate to properties of real-world entities. Examples of data models are e.g. vector data model consisting of points, lines and areas; and raster data model constituted of a grid-like structure that hold the values for each grid cell.    \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model \n",
    "  Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM) is a fundamental framework in GIS used for describing and analyzing spatial relationships between geometric objects. DE-9IM provides a matrix-based approach where the rows and columns represent the interior, boundary, and exterior of two geometric shapes being compared. By examining the intersections of these parts, a detailed characterization of their spatial relationship can be achieved, including spatial predicates such as \"touches\", \"overlaps\", and \"contains\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Docstring\n",
    "  A text string used to document a section of code. Docstrings are frequently used for functions to describe what the function does as well as providing information about input parameters and function outputs. You are encouraged to create docstrings when making functions as they can be used with the Python help function to show users how functions work.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Decimal degrees\n",
    "  A decimal degree is a method of expressing latitude and longitude geographic coordinates as decimal fractions instead of degrees, minutes, and seconds. It represents the angle between a point on the earth's surface and the equator or prime meridian, respectively, in units of decimal degrees. Decimal degrees provide a more convenient representation of geographic coordinates and make it easier to perform calculations with them.\n",

    "Inner join\n",
    "  The inner join results in a DataFrame that contains only the rows with matching keys (or binary/spatial predicate) in both original (Geo)DataFrames, excluding all rows in either (Geo)DataFrame that do not have a match in the other. The match can be based on a common key that can be found in both DataFrames (as in table join) or on a spatial predicate in case the data is merged based on the spatial relationship between two spatial data layers.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Integrated Development Environment\n",
    "  An integrated development environment or IDE is a software program or package that provides a set of tools for writing, testing, and debugging software in a convenient, practical interface.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Interpreter\n",
    "  An interpreter is a computer program that is used to execute program instructions written in Python (or other languages). The interpreter reads your statements of code and based on these instructions actually does the work that has been assigned to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "  A web application that allows users to combine rich-formtted text with code cells in an interactive document.\n",

    "  A left outer join includes all the rows from the left (Geo)DataFrame and those rows from the right (Geo)DataFrame that have a matching key in the table, or that intersect or match based on the specified spatial relationship (e.g., intersects, contains, within). If there is no matching row in the right (Geo)DataFrame for a row in the left (Geo)DataFrame, the result will still include the row from the left (Geo)DataFrame, but with missing values (NaNs) in the columns from the right (Geo)DataFrame.\n",

    "\n",
    "Spatial queries\n",
    "  A spatial query is a process in GIS commonly used e.g. to select spatial features or properties based on the spatial relationships between geospatial data layers or geometries.

    "  Topological spatial relations describe how two or more geometric objects relate to each other concerning their position and boundaries. Topological spatial relations can be exemplified by relationships such as contains, touches and intersects. In GIS, these kind of topological relations play a crucial role as they enable queries that are less concerned with the exact coordinates or shapes of geographic entities but more focused on their relative arrangements and positions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Tuple\n",
    "  A [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences) is a Python data structure that consists of a number of values separated by commas. Coordinate pairs are often represented as a tuple, such as: `(60.192059, 24.945831)`. Tuples belong to [sequence data types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq) in Python. Other sequence data types are lists and ranges. Tuples have many similarities with lists and ranges, but they are often used for different purposes. The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are [immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable), which means that the contents of a tuple cannot be altered (while lists are mutable; you can, for example, add and remove values from lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unary union\n",
    "  The unary union operation takes multiple geometries and merges them into a single geometry. This is useful when you have a collection of shapes and you want to treat them as a single entity for analysis or visualization.\n",

    "  \n",
    "Well-known binary\n",
    "  Well-known binary (WKB) is a format for representing vector geometry objects in compressed binary format which is useful for computer processing. The human-readable equivalent for WKB is `Well-known text` format. WKB can represent various geometric objects: Point, MultiPoint, LineString, MultiLineString, Polygon, MultiPolygon, Triangle, PolyhedralSurface, TIN (Triangulated irregular network) and GeometryCollection. Coordinates for the geometries can be represented in 2D, 3D or 4D (x,y,z,m).\n",
