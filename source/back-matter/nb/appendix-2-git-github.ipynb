    "We've all been in this situation before, and it seems ridiculous to have multiple nearly identical versions of the same document. Some word processors can help us deal with this situation to some extent, by storing past revisions or using Microsoft Word's \"Track Changes\" feature. However, this can be quite impractical if you would like to see modifications that are older than your previous round of changes. And just like changes to a text document, the same issue can arise when making changes to software. And even worse, sometimes your changes break the program entirely. Luckily there are tools to help avoid this problem."

    "## What is version control?\n",
    "\n",
    "*{term}`Version control`* [^versioncontrol] is used to track and store changes in your files without losing the history of your previous changes. Version control systems start with a base version of a document and then save only the changes you make at each step of the way. You can think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and start at the base document, then you can play back each change and end up with your latest version.\n",

    "\n",
    "A version control system is a tool that keeps track of these changes for us and helps us version our files ([and even merge different versions, a more advanced topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control))). It allows you to decide which changes should be included the next version, called a commit, and keeps useful metadata about those changes. The complete history of commits for a particular project and their metadata make up a repository (such as our [book material repository](https://github.com/Python-GIS-book/site)). Repositories can be kept in sync between different computers and users facilitating collaboration among different people.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most obvious reasons to use version control is to avoid the situation illustrated in Figure A.X entirely by tracking the full history of your changes in a systematic way without the need to have multiple versions of the same file. This history of changes then provides the ability to \"go back in time.\" Thus, if something goes wrong with your program, you can start from some earlier version of the file when everything was still working. You can also easily compare the differences between versions and see exactly what has changed. In addition to these benefits, version control makes it possible for multiple people to work on the same file or project at the same time while still keeping track of their own changes to the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple different Version Control Systems (VCS; software for doing version control) and one of the most popular ones is [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software))."

    "[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) is a version control software (developed in 2005 by a rather famous Finn named Linus Torvalds, who also created Linux!) that is used to track and store changes in your files (often source code for programs) without losing the history of past changes. Files in Git are stored in a repository, which you can simply think of as a directory containing files (or other directories) related to a single \"project\". In practice git takes \"snapshots\" of your files each time you commit changes and follows the idea of [distributed version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). Git is widely used by professionals to keep track of what they've done and to collaborate with other people. Git is the version control system that is running behind the scenes and used with GitHub (\"Git\" + \"Hub\"!)."

    "GitHub provides a handful of important features that build upon what is offered by Git alone:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. GitHub relies on Git. The GitHub is a web based Git repository hosting service in principle. Thus, it would not exist without the version control system Git. Git is running all the time in the background when using GitHub.\n",
    "2. GitHub is a social (collaborative) network. GitHub is much more than just a hosting service for Git repositories as it is also a social network where people can collaborate and communicate with each other. It is easy to invite other GitHub users to work together on the same project and to discuss project developments. It should thus come as no surprise that GitHub is a highly popular place for sharing codes both openly to the entire world and to smaller groups of collaborators working on the same project.\n",
    "3. GitHub supports open source software and open science. Sharing your work publicly to others is one of the basic principles of open science. All publicly available GitHub repositories can be downloaded to your own local computer where you can start modifying the codes for your own purpose. This process is called \"forking\". Be aware, however, that you should always check and follow the license terms mentioned in the project, which tell you what you can (or can not) do with the codes that are shared. It is possible that there might be some limitations for commercial use of the codes, for example.\n",
    "4. GitHub provides a home for software documentation. GitHub repositories are often also used as web pages for software projects. In GitHub, such web pages typically include technical documentation, instructions, and examples of how to use the codes or software within that project. It is extremely important that you document the codes and programs that you have created, and GitHub provides a nice platform for doing this and sharing the documentation. Almost every GitHub repository (and possibly its subfolders) includes a file called `README.md`, which is the front-page of the given repository in GitHub by default. These files are written using a specific simple language called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), which can be used to create nice looking web documents with rich formatting, figures, tables, and so on. Markdown is very easy (and fast) to use once you have learned the basic syntax of how different textual elements are written.\n",
    "5. GitHub includes useful online tools. There are multiple useful tools integrated into GitHub, such as the possibility to edit the documents or codes directly on the web site. What is even better is that Git is always running in background, so all changes made in the web browser will be saved as git commits. It is also possible to browse the complete history of a file directly from GitHub's online interface and view all of the changes that have been made.\n",
    "6. GitHub has issue tracking. In GitHub it is also possible to give feedback to the developer by creating an \"issue\" that can be used to report a bug that was found in the code or software, for example. Issues can also be used to track ideas, enhancements, or other plans to projects on GitHub. You can even use issues to organize tasks you'd like to accomplish, such as adding new features or revising old ones."

    "Here are a few basic terms that are used often when using git and GitHub (not exhaustive).\n",
    "\n",
    "- *{term}`Repository`*: A location where all the files for a particular project are stored, often referred to as a \"repo.\" Each project will have its own repo, which is usually located on a server and can be accessed by a unique URL (e.g., a link to GitHub page).\n",
    "- *{term}`Commit <Git commit>`*: To commit is to write or merge the changes made in the working copy back to the repository. When you commit, you are basically taking a \"snapshot\" of your repository at that point in time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore your project to any previous state. The terms 'commit' or 'checkin' can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is created as a result of committing.\n",
    "- *{term}`Revision`* / *{term}`Version`*: A revision or a version is any change in made in any form to a document(s).\n",
    "- *{term}`Clone <Git clone>`*: Cloning means creating a repository containing the revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized, and contain the same revisions.\n",
    "- *{term}`Pull <Git pull>` / *{term}`Push <Git push>`*: Copy revisions from one repository to another. Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update.\n",
    "- *{term}`Merge <Git merge>`*: A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets of changes are applied to a file or set of files."

    "\n",
    "The most common starting point for working with software in Git is creating a copy of the software, or \"cloning\" it. This can be done using the command `git clone`, for example. For repositories you have already copied, you can download the latest changes using the command Using `git pull`, which will fetch (and merge) new changes from GitHub. Finally, the command `git push` publishes\n",

After this, the command `git commit` can be used to record a permanent snapshot of the staged changes.
