    "The selection of variable names might seem insignificant in some ways, but poorly chosen variable names can be confusing, unclear, or even misleading. Thus, we provide some examples of both poorly and well chosen variable names below along with some tips for formatting of your variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's first consider some examples of problematic variable names.\n",

    "s = \"101533\"\n",
    "sid = \"101533\"\n",

    "Here we have two variable names that are nice and short, but it is not particularly clear what kind of value they are being used to store. The variables `s` and `sid` are simply too short and cannot communicate what they should be used for in the code. You might think you know what they are for at the moment, but imagine not looking at the code for a few months. Would you know then? What about if you share the code with a friend? Would they know? Probably not.\n",

The previous examples were too short, but now we have a variable name that is too long (and hard to read as a result)."

    "### Selecting \"good\" variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "A good variable name should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Be clear and concise. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Be written in English. A general coding practice is to write code with variable names in English, as that is the most likely common language between programmers. Thus, variable names such as `muuttuja`, the word for \"variable\" in Finnish should be avoided. Note that `muuttuja` is not a good name for other reasons as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Not contain special characters. Python supports use of special characters by way of various encoding options that can be given in a program. That said, it is better to avoid variables such as `lämpötila` (the Finnish word for temperature) because encoding issues can arise in some cases. It is recommended to stick to the [standard printable ASCII character set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) [^ascii] to be safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Not conflict with any [Python keywords](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-keywords/) [^keywords], such as `for`, `True`, `False`, `and`, `if`, or `else`. These are reserved for special operations in Python and cannot be used as variable names.\n",

    "*{term}`pothole_case naming <Pothole case>`* uses lowercase words separated by underscores `_`. This is our suggested format as the underscores make it easy to read the variable and do not add much to the length of the variable name. As an example, consider the variable `temp_celsius`. Considering our earlier examples of poor variable names, we could instead write the following.\n",

    "The choice from the formatting options above is yours, but as you may have seen, we tend to utilize pothole_case naming most often in this book. This is because we feel it is the easiest to read and seems to be most common amongst Python programmers. You are welcome to use either option, as long as you are consistent in the use. It might take an extra second of thought, but selecting and formatting your variables can make a big difference in the ease of use of your Python programs!"

    "\n",
    "- Code comments: Text within your Python programs that does not get executed when the software is run. This text is mixed within the code and often used to describe how some or all of the code works. There are several styles of code comments in Python, which are described in more detail later in this appendix.\n",
    "- Markdown text: Text written as plain text with a simple syntax that can be rendered with rich formatting (bold, italics, different font sizes, colors, etc.). In Jupyter notebooks this text is written in Markdown cells and displayed as rich text when the cells are executed. In contrast to code comments, this text is generally intended to provide a broader description of the code or other things needed to understand what you code does.\n",

    "### Do I need to describe my code?\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolutely! Providing comments or Markdown text to describe your code is essential for a number of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Code descriptions make it easier to understand your code. Although good variable names can help you and other users better understand what you code does, your Jupyter notebooks and/or script files are seldom short enough for you to be able to read over the entire code at once and fully understand what is going on. For this reason, comments and Markdown text are essential parts of making sure your notebooks are easy to use and understand section by section.\n",
    "2. Code descriptions make it easier for other users to use your code. Even when writing simple software it is worthwhile to take the time to include some extra documentation about how it works. Everyone has their own tendencies in how they write their software and by including a few comments and/or Markdown text you can make it much easier for people to understand and use your work.\n",
    "3. Writing code descriptions can help you debug your code. Over time you will gain more experience with understanding why some piece of code does not work the way it should. One way to help fix (or debug) your code is to add comments stating what each line does. By taking things step by step, you may find that your code actually does not do what you thought, and this can help you be able to find and fix issues.\n",
    "4. Code descriptions are a big part of why Jupyter notebooks are so powerful. Code comments are quite helpful in general, but one of the biggest features of a Jupyter notebook is the ability to mix rich text with your code. With this platform you can even write scientific texts with embedded code cells to be able to perform calculations, analyze data, and visualize your results. This powerful platform is an excellent open science tool that provides a clear means to reproduce your results on demand.\n",

In essence, the argument is that if you need comments to understand what the code does, it is not good code. The advice is not that you should never comment in your code, but rather that comments are really only needed to describe why something is done a given way (not what is done). While this is true to a degree, this advice does not apply to most of us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of us are only just getting started with programming, and our comments serve a bit different purpose. For new programmers, comments make sure we understand what each line of our code does and helps others who you share your code with understand as well. In addition, writing comments can make you pause, look at your code, and then come up with a way to describe what you have done. For new programmers, this makes for excellent practice!"

    "\n",
    "According to the good coding practices described in [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#imports) [^pep8_imports], we should always import modules at the top of a file. In this section, we have demonstrated how to import different modules along the way, but in general it is better to import required modules as the very first thing. PEP 8 refers more to traditional script files, but we can apply the guideline to Jupyter Notebook files as well by placing `import` statements in the first code cell of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Avoid importing functions using wildcards\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best not to import many functions from a module using the form `from X import *`, where `X` is a Python module. `from X import *` will import all of the functions in module X, and though you might think this is helpful, it is much better to simply `import X` or `import X as Y` to maintain the connection between the functions and their module. In addition to losing the connection between the module and the function, it is much more likely you will encounter conflicting function names when using `from X import *`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choose logical names when renaming on import\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not use confusing names when renaming on import. Be smart when you import modules, and follow generally used conventions (`import pandas as pd` is a good way to do things!). If you want to make the module name shorter on import, pick a reasonable abbreviation. For instance, `import matplotlib as m` could be confusing, especially if we used `import math as m` above and might do so in other Jupyter notebooks or script files. Similarly, `import matplotlib as math` is perfectly OK syntax in Python, but bound to cause trouble. Remember, people need to be able to read and understand the code you write. Keep it simple and logical."

Instead, more advanced programmers recommend using assertions only to test that your code is working properly internally. For example, you would use assertions to check for things that should not happen, such as functions that duplicate values in lists when they should not. The reason it is not recommended to use assertions for testing user input values or the existence of files is that assertions can be disabled using flags when running a Python program. Thus, it is possible they could be ignored entirely. This is fine when debugging code, but obviously not desired when users are running your programs. If you're interested in more details, you can find more in [an article on using assertions in the Python wiki](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingAssertionsEffectively) [^wiki_assertions] or on the [Software Carpentry website](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/10-defensive.html) [^swc_assertions]."
