    "# Geocoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoding is the process of transforming place names or addresses into coordinates. In this section we will learn how to geocode addresses using `geopandas` and [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) [^geopy].\n",
    "\n",
    "Geopy and other geocoding libaries (such as [geocoder](http://geocoder.readthedocs.io/)) make it easy to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using web services (\"geocoders\"). In practice, geocoders are often *{term}`Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) <API>`* where you can send requests, and receive responses in the form of place names, addresses and coordinates. Geopy offers access to several geocoding services, such as [Photon](https://photon.komoot.io/]) [^photon] and [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/) [^nominatim] that rely on data from OpenStreetMap, among various other services. Check the [geopy documentation](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) [^geopy] for more a list of supported geocoding services and usage details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geocoding services might require an API key in order to use them. (i.e. you\n",
    "need to register for the service before you can access results from their API).\n",
    "Furthermore, rate limiting also restrict the use of these services. The\n",
    "geocoding process might end up in an error if you are making too many requests\n",
    "in a short time period (eg.  trying to geocode large number of addresses). If you pay for the geocoding service, you can naturally make more requests to the\n",
    "API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will use the Nominatim geocoder for locating a relatively\n",
    "small number of addresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to pay attention to the geocoding providers' Terms of Use. For example, the Nominatim API is not meant for super heavy use. Nominatim doesn't require the use of an API key, but the usage of the Nominatim service is rate-limited to 1 request per second (3600 / hour). Users also need to provide an identifier for their application, and give appropriate attribution to using OpenStreetMap data. You can read more about Nominatim usage policy in [here](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/) [^nominatim_toc]. When using Nominatim via `geopandas` and `geopy`, we can specify a custom a custom `user_agent` parameter to idenfy our application, and we can add a `timeout` to allow enough time to get the response from the service. \n",
