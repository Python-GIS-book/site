    "## Managing Coordinate Reference Systems in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 5, we learned how the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) ultimately describes how geometries are related to the places on Earth and what are the core components of a CRS. Our main tool for managing coordinate reference systems is the [PROJ library](https://proj.org/) [^proj] which can be used through the [pyproj Python library](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/) [^pyproj]. `Pyproj` can be used to access the CRS information of a given geographic dataset and also for reprojecting the data from one coordinate system to another. In the following, we will demonstrate how to work with coordinate reference systems in `geopandas` by using a country border dataset from Europe. We will reproject the dataset from the original WGS84 coordinate system into a Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection which is the projection EU [recommends for Europe](http://mapref.org/LinkedDocuments/MapProjectionsForEurope-EUR-20120.pdf) [^EU_projection].\n",

    "Let's start by reading the data from the `eu_countries_2022.gpkg` file. When reading the data into `GeoDataFrame` with `geopandas`, the CRS information is automatically read from the datafile and stored into the `.crs` attribute:"
