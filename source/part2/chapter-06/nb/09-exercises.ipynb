    "In this exercise your task is to create custom functions for creating geometries. We start with a very simple function, and proceed to creating functions that can handle invalid input values. In addition to the contents of chapter 6, you will need basic knowledge of creating functions (see Part I chapter 2.6) and using assertions (see Appendix).\n",
