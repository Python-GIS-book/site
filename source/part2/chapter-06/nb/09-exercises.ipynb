    "The goal of this exercise is to create geometries based on text file input in Python. You will combine basic knowledge of the `pandas` module (see Part I) with `geopandas` methods introduced in this chapter. The text file **[travelTimes_2015_Helsinki.txt](data/travelTimes_2015_Helsinki.txt)** is located in the data folder and consist of travel times between multiple origin locations and one destination location. This file is an extract of the Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix dataset - an open data set that contains multimodal travel time information across the Helsinki Region in Finland (ref). Here, we will focus on the public transport travel times to the Helsinki railway station. \n",
