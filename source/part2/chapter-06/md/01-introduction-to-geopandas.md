# Introduction to spatial data analysis with geopandas

Now as we have learned how to create and represent geographic data in Python using `shapely` objects, we will continue and use [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) [^geopandas] as our main tool for spatial data analysis. Geopandas extends the capacities of pandas (which we covered in the Part I of the book) with geospatial operations. The main data structures in geopandas are `GeoSeries` and `GeoDataFrame` which extend the capabilities of `Series` and `DataFrames` from pandas. This means that we can use many familiar methods from pandas also when working with geopandas and spatial features. A `GeoDataFrame` is basically a `pandas.DataFrame` that contains one column for geometries. The geometry column is a `GeoSeries` which contains the geometries  as `shapely` objects (points, lines, polygons, multipolygons etc.). 

## Getting started with geopandas

Similar to importing import pandas as `pd`, we will import geopandas as `gpd`:

```python
import geopandas as gpd
```

## Reading a file

In `geopandas`, we can use a generic function `.from_file()` for reading in various data formats. The data-folder contains some census data from Austin, Texas downloaded from the [U.S Census bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html) [^us_census]. Let's first define the path to the file.

```python
from pathlib import Path

data_folder = Path("data")
fp = data_folder/ "Austin" / "austin_pop_2019.gpkg"
print(fp)
```

Now we can pass this filepath to `geopandas`.

```python
data = gpd.read_file(fp)
```

Let's check the data type.

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
type(data)
```

Here we see that our `data` -variable is a `GeoDataFrame` which extends the functionalities of
`DataFrame` to handle spatial data. We can apply many familiar `pandas` methods to explore the contents of our `GeoDataFrame`. Let's have a closer look at the first rows of the data. 

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
data.head()
```

#### Question 6.2

Figure out the following information from our input data using your `pandas` skills:
    
- Number of rows?
- Number of census tracts (based on column `tract`)?
- Total population (based on column `pop2019`)?

```python tags=["remove_cell"]
# You can use this cell to enter your solution.
```

```python tags=["remove_book_cell", "hide_cell"]
# Solution 

print("Number of rows", len(data))
print("Number of census tract", data["tract"].nunique())
print("Total population", data["pop2019"].sum())
```

It is always a good idea to explore your data also on a map. Creating a simple map from a `GeoDataFrame` is really easy. You can use the ``.plot()`` -function from geopandas that creates a map based on the geometries of the data. `geopandas` actually uses `matplotlib` for plotting which we introduced in Part 1 of this book. Let's try it out, and do a quick visualization of our data.

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
data.plot()
```

Voil√°! Now we have a quick overview of the geometries in this data. The x and y axes in the plot are based on the coordiante values of the geometries.


## Geometries in geopandas

A `GeoDataFrame` has one column for storing geometries. By default, `geopandas` looks for the geometries from a column called `geometry`. It is also possible to define other columns as the geometry column. Th geometry column is a `GeoSeries` that contains shapely's geometric objects.  Let's have a look at the geometry column of our sample data.

```python jupyter={"outputs_hidden": false}
data["geometry"].head()
```

As we can see here,  the `geometry` column contains polygon geometries. Since these polygons are  `shapely` objects, it is possible to use `shapely` methods for handling them also in `geopandas`. Many of the methods can be applied all at once to the whole `GeoDataFrame`. 

Let's proceed to calculating area of the census tract polygons. At this point, it is good to note that the census data are in a metric coordinate reference system, so the area values will be given in square meters.

```python
data["geometry"].area
```

The same result can be achieved by using the syntax `data.area`. Let's convert the area values from square meters to square kilometers and store them into a new column.

```python
# Get area and convert from m2 to km2
data["area_km2"] = data.area / 1000000
```

Check the output.

```python
data["area_km2"].head()
```

## Question 6.3

Using your `pandas` skills, create a new column `pop_density_km2` and populate it with population density values (population / km2) calculated based on columns `pop2019` and `area_km2`. Print out answers to the following questions:

- What was the average population density in 2019?
- What was the maximum population density per census tract?

```python tags=["remove_cell"]
# Use this cell to enter your solution.
```

```python tags=["remove_book_cell", "hide_cell"]
# Solution 

# Calculate population density
data["pop_density_km2"] = data["pop2019"] / data["area_km2"]

# Print out average and maximum values
print("Average:", 
      round(data["pop_density_km2"].mean()), "pop/km2")

print("Maximum:", 
      round(data["pop_density_km2"].max()), "pop/km2")
```

## Writing data into a file

It is possible to export spatial data into various data formats using the `.to_file()` method in `geopandas`. Let's practice writing data into the geopackage file format. Before proceeding, let's check how the data looks like at this point.

```python
data.head()
```

Let's create a folder  (if it doens't exist) and file name for our result. We will use geopackage also as the output format. 

```python
# Create a output path for the data
output_folder = Path("data/results")

if not output_folder.exists():
    output_folder.mkdir()

output_fp = output_folder / "austin_pop_density_2019.gpkg"
```

Write the data into a file using the `.to_file()` method.

```python
data.to_file(output_fp)
```

#### Question 6.4

Read the output file using `geopandas` and check that the data looks ok.

```python tags=["remove_cell"]
# Use this cell to enter your solution.
```

```python tags=["remove_book_cell", "hide_cell"]
# Solution

temp = gpd.read_file(output_fp)

# Check first rows
temp.head()
```

```python tags=["remove_book_cell", "hide_cell"]
# Solution

# You can also plot the data for a visual check
temp.plot()
```
