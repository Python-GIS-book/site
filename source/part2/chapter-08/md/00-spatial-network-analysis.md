# Spatial network analysis

This section focuses on spatial networks and learning how to construct a routable directed graph for `networkx` library that can be used to find a shortest paths along the given street network based on travel times or distance by given transport mode (e.g. car or cycling). Finding a shortest path from A to B using a specific street network is a very common problem in GIS that has many practical applications.

Python provides easy to use tools for conducting spatial network analysis. One of the easiest ways to start is to use a library called [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/)
which is a Python module that provides a lot tools that can be used to analyze networks on various different ways. It also contains algorithms such as [Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.single_source_dijkstra.html#networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.weighted.single_source_dijkstra) or [A\*](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.astar.astar_path.html#networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths.astar.astar_path)
algoritm that are commonly used to find shortest paths along transportation network that can help e.g. in way-finding.

## Typical workflow for routing

If you want to conduct network analysis (in any programming language) there are a few basic steps that typically needs to be done before you can start routing. These steps are:

 1. **Retrieve data** (such as street network from OSM or Digiroad + possibly transit data if routing with PT).
 2. **Modify the network** by adding/calculating edge weights (such as travel times based on speed limit and length of the road segment).
 3. **Build a routable graph** for the routing tool that you are using (e.g. for NetworkX, igraph or OpenTripPlanner).
 4. **Conduct network analysis** (such as shortest path analysis) with the routing tool of your choice. 
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
## Retrieving network data

As a first step, we need to obtain data for routing. [osmnx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library makes it really easy to retrieve routable networks from OpenStreetMap (OSM) with different transport modes (walking, cycling and driving). 

Let's first extract OSM data for Helsinki city centre that are drivable by car. In `osmnx`, we can use a function called `ox.graph_from_place()` which retrieves data from OpenStreetMap. It is possible to specify what kind of roads should be retrieved from OSM with `network_type` -parameter (supports e.g. `walk`, `drive`, `bike`, `all`). In the following, we fetch all the drivable roads from "Kamppi, Helsinki":
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
import osmnx as ox
import geopandas as gpd
import pandas as pd
import networkx as nx

# The area of interest
query = "Kamppi, Helsinki"

# We will use test data for Helsinki that comes with pyrosm
G = ox.graph_from_place(query, network_type="drive", simplify=False)

type(G)
```

Okay, as we can see we have now fetched a routable graph out of OpenStreetMap data of ours which is something called `MultiDiGraph` object of `networkx` library. Let's remind us about the basic elements of a graph that we went through in the lecture slides:

![Basic elements of a graph](../img/graph_elements.png)

So basically this graph `G` is made out of **nodes** and **edges**. We can easily extract the `nodes` and `edges` out of this graph by using `osmnx` as follows: 

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
# Extract the nodes and edges
nodes, edges = ox.graph_to_gdfs(G)
edges.head()
```

```python
ax = edges.plot()
ax = nodes.plot(ax=ax, color="red", markersize=3.5)
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Okay, now we have drivable roads as a GeoDataFrame for the Kamppi district of Helsinki. If you look at the GeoDataFrame, we can see that `osmnx` has also calculated us the `length` of each road segment (presented in meters). The geometries are presented here as `LineString` objects. 

In OSM, the information about the allowed direction of movement is stored in column `oneway`. Let's take a look what kind of values we have in that column:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
edges["oneway"].unique()
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
As we can see the unique values in that column are `True` and `False`. This information can be used to construct a `directed` graph for routing by car. For walking and cycling, you typically want create a `bidirectional` graph, because the travel is typically allowed in both directions at least in Finland. Notice, that the rules vary by country, e.g. in Copenhagen you have oneway rules also for bikes but typically each road have the possibility to travel both directions (you just need to change the side of the road if you want to make a U-turn). Column `maxspeed` contains information about the speed limit for given road:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
edges["maxspeed"].unique()
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
As we can see, there are also `None` values in the data, meaning that the speed limit has not been tagged for some roads. This is typical, and often you need to fill the non existing speed limits yourself. This can be done by taking advantage of the road class that is always present in column `highway`:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
edges["highway"].unique()
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Based on these values, we can make assumptions that e.g. `residential` roads in Helsinki have a speed limit of 30 kmph. Hence, this information can be used to fill the missing values in `maxspeed`. 

The second dataset that we extracted from the graph are `nodes`:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python
nodes.head()
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
As we can see, the `nodes` GeoDataFrame contains information about the coordinates of each node as well as a unique `id` for each node. These `id` values are used to determine the connectivity in our network. Hence, `pyrosm` has also added two columns to the `edges` GeoDataFrame that specify **from** and **to** ids for each edge. Column `u` contains information about the **from-id** and column `v` about the **to-id** accordingly:
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Okay, as we can see now we have both the roads (i.e. *edges*) and the nodes that connect the street elements together (in red color in the previous figure) that are typically intersections. However, we can see that many of the nodes are in locations that are clearly not intersections. This is intented behavior to ensure that we have full **connectivity** in our network. We can at later stage clean and simplify this network by merging all roads that belong to the same link (i.e. street elements that are between two intersections) which also reduces the size of the network. 

```{note} 

In OSM, the street topology is typically not directly suitable for graph traversal due to missing nodes at intersections which means that the roads are not splitted at those locations. The consequence of this, is that it is not possible to make a turn if there is no intersection present in the data structure. Hence, `pyrosm` will separate all road segments/geometries into individual rows in the data. 
```
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
## Modifying the network

At this stage, we have the necessary components to build a routable graph (nodes and edges) based on distance. However, in real life the network distance is not the best cost metric to use, because the shortest path (based on distance) is not necessarily always the optimal route in terms of **travel time**. Time is typically the measure that people value more (plus it is easier to comprehend), so at this stage we want to **add a new cost attribute** to our edges GeoDataFrame that converts the metric distance information to travel time (in seconds) based on following formula:

 - `<distance-in-meters> / (<speed-limit-kmph> / 3.6)`
 
Before we can do this calculation, we need to ensure that all rows in `maxspeed` column have information about the speed limit. Let's check the value counts of the column and also include information about the `NaN` values with `dropna` parameter:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
# Count values
edges["maxspeed"].value_counts(dropna=False)
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
As we can see, the rows which do not contain information about the speed limit is the second largest group in our data. Hence, we need to apply a criteria to fill these gaps. We can do this based on following "rule of thumb" criteria in Finland (notice that these vary country by country):

| Road class           | Speed limit within urban region | Speed limit outside urban region |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| motorway             | 100                             | 120                              |
| motorway_link        | 80                              | 80                               |
| trunk                | 60                              | 100                              |
| trunk_link           | 60                              | 60                               |
| primary              | 50                              | 80                               |
| primary_link         | 50                              | 50                               |
| secondary            | 50                              | 50                               |
| secondary_link       | 50                              | 50                               |
| tertiary             | 50                              | 60                               |
| tertiary_link        | 50                              | 50                               |
| unclassified         | 50                              | 80                               |
| unclassified_link    | 50                              | 50                               |
| residential          | 50                              | 80                               |
| living_street        | 20                              | NA                               |
| service              | 30                              | NA                               |
| other                | 50                              | 80                               |

For simplicity, we can consider that all the roads in Helsinki Region follows the *within urban region* speed limits, although this is not exactly true (the higher speed limits start somewhere at the outer parts of the city region). For making the speed limit values more robust / correct, you could use data about urban/rural classification which is available in Finland from [Finnish Environment Institute](https://www.avoindata.fi/data/fi/dataset/kaupunki-maaseutu-luokitus-ykr). Let's first convert our `maxspeed` values to integers using `astype()` method:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
edges["maxspeed"] = edges["maxspeed"].astype(float).astype(pd.Int64Dtype())
edges["maxspeed"].unique()
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
As we can see, now the maxspeed values are stored in integer format inside an `IntegerArray`, and the `None` values were converted into `pandas.NA` objects that are assigned with `<NA>`. Now we can create a function that returns a numeric value for different road classes based on the criteria in the table above:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
def road_class_to_kmph(road_class):
    """
    Returns a speed limit value based on road class, 
    using typical Finnish speed limit values within urban regions.
    """
    if road_class == "motorway":
        return 100
    elif road_class == "motorway_link":
        return 80
    elif road_class in ["trunk", "trunk_link"]:
        return 60
    elif road_class == "service":
        return 30
    elif road_class == "living_street":
        return 20
    else:
        return 50
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Now we can apply this function to all rows that **do not have speed limit information**:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python
mask = edges["maxspeed"].isnull()
```

```python
mask
```

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
# Separate rows with / without speed limit information 
mask = edges["maxspeed"].isnull()
edges_without_maxspeed = edges.loc[mask].copy()
edges_with_maxspeed = edges.loc[~mask].copy()

# Apply the function and update the maxspeed
edges_without_maxspeed["maxspeed"] = edges_without_maxspeed["highway"].apply(road_class_to_kmph)
edges_without_maxspeed.head(5).loc[:, ["maxspeed", "highway"]]
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Okay, as we can see now the `maxspeed` value have been updated according our criteria, and e.g. the `living_street` road class have been given the speed limit 20 kmph. Now we can recreate the edges GeoDataFrame by combining the two frames: 
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
edges = pd.concat([edges_with_maxspeed, edges_without_maxspeed])
edges["maxspeed"].unique()
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Great, now all of our edges have information about the speed limit. We can also visualize them:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
# Convert the value into regular integer Series (the plotting requires having Series instead of IntegerArray) 
edges["maxspeed"] = edges["maxspeed"].astype(int)
ax = edges.plot(column="maxspeed", figsize=(16,10), legend=True)
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Finally, we can calculate the travel time in seconds using the formula we saw earlier and add that as a new cost attribute for our network:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
edges["travel_time_seconds"] = edges["length"] / (edges["maxspeed"]/3.6)
edges.iloc[0:10, -4:]
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Excellent! Now our GeoDataFrame has all the information we need for creating a graph that can be used to conduct shortest path analysis based on length or travel time. Notice that here we assume that the cars can drive with the same speed as what the speed limit is. Considering the urban dynamics and traffic congestion, this assumption might not hold, but for simplicity, we assume so in this tutorial. 
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
### Building a routable graph from modified edges

We can use `osmnx` library to easily build a directed graph. Let's see how we can create a routable NetworkX graph using `osmnx` with one command:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
G = ox.graph_from_gdfs(gdf_nodes=nodes, gdf_edges=edges)
G
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Now we have a similar routable graph as in the beginning, but now the network edges contain information about the speed limit for all edges. We can easily visualize the graph with `osmnx` as follows: 
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
import osmnx as ox 
ox.plot_graph(G)
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
## Shortest path analysis 

Now we have everything we need to start routing with NetworkX (based on driving distance or travel time). But first, let's again go through some basics about routing.

### Basic logic in routing

Most (if not all) routing algorithms work more or less in a similar manner. The basic steps for finding an optimal route from A to B, is to:
 1. Find the nearest node for origin location \* (+ get info about its node-id and distance between origin and node)
 2. Find the nearest node for destination location \* (+ get info about its node-id and distance between origin and node)
 3. Use a routing algorithm to find the shortest path between A and B
 4. Retrieve edge attributes for the given route(s) and summarize them (can be distance, time, CO2, or whatever)
 
\* in more advanced implementations you might search for the closest edge

This same logic should be applied always when searching for an optimal route between a single origin to a single destination, or when calculating one-to-many -type of routing queries (producing e.g. travel time matrices). 
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
## Find the optimal route between two locations

Next, we will learn how to find the shortest path between two locations using [Dijkstra's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) algorithm.

First, let's find the closest nodes for two locations that are located in the area. OSMnx provides a handly function for geocoding an address `ox.geocode()`. We can use that to retrieve the x and y coordinates of our origin and destination.
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
# OSM data is in WGS84 so typically we need to use lat/lon coordinates when searching for the closest node

# Origin
orig_address = "Ruoholahdenkatu 24, Helsinki"
orig_y, orig_x = ox.geocode(orig_address)  # notice the coordinate order (y, x)!

# Destination
dest_address = "Annankatu 18, Helsinki"
dest_y, dest_x = ox.geocode(dest_address) 

print("Origin coords:", orig_x, orig_y)
print("Destination coords:", dest_x, dest_y)
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Okay, now we have coordinates for our origin and destination.

### Find the nearest nodes

Next, we need to find the closest nodes from the graph for both of our locations. For calculating the closest point we use `ox.distance.nearest_nodes()` -function and specify `return_dist=True` to get the distance in meters.
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
# Find the closest nodes for origin and destination
orig_node_id, dist_to_orig = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(G, X=orig_x, Y=orig_y, return_dist=True)
dest_node_id, dist_to_dest = ox.distance.nearest_nodes(G, X=dest_x, Y=dest_y, return_dist=True)

print("Origin node-id:", orig_node_id, "and distance:", dist_to_orig, "meters.")
print("Destination node-id:", dest_node_id, "and distance:", dist_to_dest, "meters.")
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Now we are ready to start the actual routing with NetworkX. 
<!-- #endregion -->

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
### Find the fastest route by distance / time

Now we can do the routing and find the shortest path between the origin and target locations
by using the `dijkstra_path()` function of NetworkX. For getting only the cumulative cost of the trip, we can directly use a function `dijkstra_path_length()` that returns the travel time without the actual path. 

With `weight` -parameter we can specify the attribute that we want to use as cost/impedance. We have now three possible weight attributes available: `'length'` and `'travel_time_seconds'`.    

- Let's first calculate the routes between locations by walking and cycling, and also retrieve the travel times
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
# Calculate the paths 
metric_path = nx.dijkstra_path(G, source=orig_node_id, target=dest_node_id, weight='length')
time_path = nx.dijkstra_path(G, source=orig_node_id, target=dest_node_id, weight='travel_time_seconds')

# Get also the actual travel times (summarize)
travel_length = nx.dijkstra_path_length(G, source=orig_node_id, target=dest_node_id, weight='length')
travel_time = nx.dijkstra_path_length(G, source=orig_node_id, target=dest_node_id, weight='travel_time_seconds')
```

```python
metric_path == time_path
```

```python
travel_length
```

```python
travel_time
```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Okay, that was it! Let's now see what we got as results by visualizing the results.

For visualization purposes, we can use a handy function again from OSMnx called `ox.plot_graph_route()` that plots the route in a simple map:
<!-- #endregion -->

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
# Shortest path based on distance
fig, ax = ox.plot_graph_route(G, metric_path, 
                              edge_linewidth=0.2, node_size=0, bgcolor="white", edge_color="black", figsize=(14,10))

# Print some useful information as well
print(f"Shortest path distance {travel_length: .1f} meters.")
```

```python pycharm={"name": "#%%\n"}
fig, ax = ox.plot_graph_route(G, time_path,
                             edge_linewidth=0.2, node_size=0, bgcolor="white", edge_color="black", figsize=(14,10))

# Print some useful information as well
print(f"Shortest path time {travel_time/60: .1f} minutes.")

```

<!-- #region pycharm={"name": "#%% md\n"} -->
Great! Now we have successfully found the optimal route between our origin and destination and we also have estimates about the travel time that it takes to travel between the locations by driving. As we can see, the route optimized based on travel time and distance were exactly the same which is natural, as the network here is relatively small and there are no big differences in the speed limits. However, with larger networks, you might get alternating routes as travelling e.g. via ring roads is typically faster than driving throught the city (as an example). 
<!-- #endregion -->
