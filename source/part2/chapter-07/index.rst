7. Raster data processing
=========================

In this chapter, we will introduce how to conduct various data analysis and manipulation operations in Python using raster data. You will learn to use a few of the core libraries for raster analysis/processing, such as `xarray` and `rioxarray`. More specifically this chapter will cover:

- Introduction to raster processing
- Reading and writing raster data (Data I/O)
- Reprojecting raster data
- Mosaicing
- Raster resampling
- Map algebra – Doing calculations with raster data
- Raster to Polygon - Polygon to raster
- Masking / clipping
