    "Chapter 7 provides an overview of raster data processing in Python. You will learn how raster surfaces can be represented and manipulated in Python, how coordinate reference system for a given raster layer can be defined and modified, and learn how to conduct common geocomputational techniques with raster data, such as clipping, masking, merging or reprojecting raster datasets or conducting map algebraic operations between one or multiple raster layers or between raster and vector layers.\n",

    "Basic knowledge of raster data and arrays introduced in Chapter 5.2 as well as knowing how the data structures work in `pandas` (Chapter 3) and `geopandas` (Chapter 6) are recommended for learning efficiently how to use `xarray` and related libraries to work with raster data in Python."
