    "\n",
    "Earlier in this chapter we saw how it is possible to combine character strings and numbers using the `+` operator between the different text components. Although this approach works, it can become quite laborious and error prone when you have a more complicated set of textual and/or numerical components that you work with. Hence, we next show a few useful techniques that make manipulating strings easier and more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three approaches that can be used to manipulate strings in Python: (1) f-strings, (2) using the`.format()` method, and (3) using the `%` operator. We recommend using the f-string approach, but we also provide examples of the two other approaches because there are plenty of examples and code snippets on the web where these string formatting approaches are still used. Hence, it is good to be aware of them all. In addition, we show a few useful methods that make working with text in different ways possible."

    "As you can see, using string formatting it is possible to easily modify a body of text \"interactively\" based on values stored in given variables. Figure 2.2 breaks down the different parts of the string. The text that you want to create and/or modify is enclosed within the quotes preceded with letter `f`. You can pass any existing variable inside the text template by placing the name of the variable within the curly braces `{}`. Using string formatting, it is also possible to insert numbers (such as `station_id` and `temp`) within the body of text without needing first to convert the data types to strings. This is because the f-string functionality kindly does the data type conversion for us in the background without us needing to worry about it (handy!). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to round numbers on the fly to specific precision, such as the two decimal points in our example, by adding the format specifier (`:.2f`) after the variable that we want to round. The format specifier works by first adding a colon (`:`) after the variable name, and then specifying with dot (`.`) that we want to round our value to 2 decimal places (can be any number of digits). The final character `f` in the format specifier defines the type of the formatting that will be done: the character `f` will display the value as a decimal number, the character `e` would make the number appear in scientific notation, while the character `%` would convert the value to percentage representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we have hopefully demonstrated, f-string formatting is easy to use, yet powerful with its capability to do data conversions on the fly, for example. Hence, it is the recommended approach for doing string manipulation presently in Python. Just remember to add the letter `f` before your string template! "

    "Looks good. Now we can define the remaining pieces needed to create our sentences and concatenate them to form the target sentences. Note that we want to have the second sentence on a separate line, which means we will need to insert a special character to split the text onto two lines. For this, we can use the newline character `\\n`, which indicates the end of a line. Text that follows the newline character will appear on a separate line. In our example, we can simply include `\\n` in the character string where we would like the line to be split."

    "Nice! By simply breaking down the sentence into smaller character string segments we were able to use the `+` operator to create two sentences containing several numerical values combined in various ways. It is important to pay attention to spaces and characters such as parentheses, if you have them in your string, but otherwise string concatenation is an easy way to build more complex strings from smaller pieces."
