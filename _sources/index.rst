This is an online version of the book *"Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis"*, in which we introduce the basics of Python programming and geographic data analysis for all "geo-minded" people (geographers, geologists and others using spatial data). A physical copy of the book will be published later by CRC Press (Taylor & Francis Group). The contents of the book will be developed and shared freely online at `pythongis.org <https://pythongis.org>`_ licensed under Creative Commons 4.0.

The book consists of 4 parts:

         This part provides essential building blocks for processing, analyzing and visualizing geographic data using open source Python packages.

    .. grid-item-card:: Part 3: Geographic data analysis applications
         :link: part3/index.html
         :columns: 12 12 5 5

         This part of the book will introduce several real-world examples of how to apply geographic data analysis in Python. It assumes that you understand the key concepts presented in previous parts.

    .. grid-item-card:: Appendices: Working efficiently with Python
         :link: appendices/index.html
