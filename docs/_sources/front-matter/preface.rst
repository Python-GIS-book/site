Preface
=======

**This should go to a separate section where we guide how to use this book / online resource:**


Materials in this book are built from *{term}`Jupyter Notebooks <Jupyter notebook>`* [^jupyter]. Jupyter notebooks are documents that are divided into cells that can contain *{term}`Markdown`* [^markdown] text, Python code, or raw text. You can execute a snippet of code in a notebook cell by pressing **Shift-Enter**. This particular notebook is designed to introduce you to a few of the basic concepts of programming in Python.

If you would like to interact with the contents of this notebook, you can find the notebooks online at <https://pythongis.org>. Once you navigate to the page for this lesson, you can use the rocket ship icon at the top of the page to open an interactive version of this notebook using Binder. This will open [Jupyter Lab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) [^jupyterlab] using a cloud computer and allow you to use the notebook interactively to follow the lesson.
