    "\n",
    "A *{term}`function`* is a block of organized, reusable code that can make your programs more effective, easier to read, and simple to manage. You can think functions as little self-contained programs that can perform a specific task that you can use repeatedly in your code. One of the basic principles in good programming is \"do not to repeat yourself\". In other words, you should avoid having duplicate lines of code in your scripts. Functions are a good way to avoid such situations and they can save you a lot of time and effort as you don't need to tell the computer repeatedly what to do every time it does a common task, such as converting temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius. During the course we have already used some functions such as the `print()` command which is actually a built-in function in Python."

    "A documentation string, or a *{term}`docstring`* is a block of text that describes what a specific function, library, or script does and how to use it. Surprise surprise, PEP 8 contains [more guidance about documentation strings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#documentation-strings) [^pep8_docstring], and docstrings even have [their own guide page](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) [^pep257]. Let's look an an example from our of our functions above.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def kelvins_to_celsius(temp_kelvins):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Converts temperature in Kelvins to degrees Celsius.\"\"\"\n",
    "    return temp_kelvins - 273.15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can see a short bit of text explaining in simple language what this function does. In this case our function is quite simple, but the docstring still helps remove uncertainty about what it can be used to do. So, what can we see in this example?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A docstring is always the first statement in a module or a function.\n",
    "- Docstrings are written using `\"\"\"triple double quotation marks\"\"\"`.\n",
    "- Short docstrings [can be written on a single line](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/#one-line-docstrings) [^pep257_one_line].\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems simple enough, right? We can also provide more detailed docstrings, which can be particularly helpful when using functions with multiple parameters. Let's expand the docstring above to provide more information about this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def kelvins_to_celsius(temp_kelvins):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Converts temperature in Kelvins to degrees Celsius.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you can now see more information about the expected values for the parameters and what will be returned when using the function. This level of documentation is not needed for every function, but clearly it can be useful, especially when you have multiple parameters. Note here that the suggested format is to have the quotation marks on their own separate lines."
