# Notes

1. The GitHub Classroom intro should perhaps be part of the material for the exercises. Perhaps this is best to have in the Appendices? Exercises would make sense to have at the end of each chapter.
2. The course environment components should be edited to cut out parts that are not relevant (Slack, presemo, etc.). Where should the intro to JuptyerLab go? What about the software install?
3. How to we want to integrate the GCPs?
