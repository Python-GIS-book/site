    "In this exercise, you will clean the data from our data file by removing no-data values, convert temperature values in Fahrenheit to Celsius, and split the data into separate datasets using the weather station identification code. We will start this problem by cleaning and converting our temperature data. An overview of the tasks in this exercise:\n",

    "In this Exercise, we will explore our temperature data by comparing spring temperatures between Kumpula and Rovaniemi. To do this we'll use some conditions to extract subsets of our data and then analyse these subsets using basic pandas functions.

    "In this problem you should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Summarize the information for each day by aggregating (grouping) the DataFrame using the `groupby()` function.\n",
    "- The output should be a new DataFrame where you have calculated mean, max and min Celsius temperatures for each day separately based on hourly values.\n",
