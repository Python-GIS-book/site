11: Spatial network analysis
============================

This tutorial focuses on spatial networks and learn how to construct a routable directed graph for `networkx` library and find shortest paths along the given street network based on travel times or distance by car. In addition, we will learn how to calculate travel times matrices for different travel modes (public transport, car, bike, walking) using `r5py` library.
