    "[Spatial join](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/Spatial_Join) is\n",
    "yet another classic GIS problem. Getting attributes from one layer and\n",
    "transferring them into another layer based on their spatial relationship\n",
    "is something you most likely need to do on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section we learned how to perform **a Point in Polygon query**.\n",
    "We can now use the same logic to conduct **a spatial join** between two layers based on their\n",

    "attributes of a polygon that ``contains`` the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, [spatial join is already implemented in Geopandas](http://geopandas.org/mergingdata.html#spatial-joins), thus we do not need to create our own function for doing it. There are three possible types of\n",
    "join that can be applied in spatial join that are determined with ``op`` -parameter in the ``gpd.sjoin()`` -function:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  ``\"intersects\"``\n",

    "in the [Point in Polygon lesson](point-in-polygon.ipynb), thus you should know how they work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, pay attention to the different options for the type of join via the `how` parameter; \"left\", \"right\" and \"inner\". You can read more about these options in the [geopandas sjoin documentation](http://geopandas.org/mergingdata.html#sjoin-arguments) and pandas guide for [merge, join and concatenate](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html)\n",

Using it also requires taking the `unary union` of the point dataset where all the Points are merged into a single layer. This can be a really memory hungry and slow operation, that can cause problems with large point datasets.  \n",

The Balltree algorithm has some nice features, such as the ability to calculate the distance between neighbors with various different distance metrics. Most importantly the function allows to calculate `euclidian` distance between neighbors (good if your data is in metric crs), as well as `haversine` distance which allows to determine [Great Circle distances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) between locations (good if your data is in lat/lon format). *Note: There is also an algorithm called [KDTree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KDTree.html#sklearn.neighbors.KDTree) in scikit-learn, that is also highly efficient but less flexible in terms of supported distance metrics.* "

    "To get a bit more understanding of what just happened, let's go through the essential parts of the two functions we defined earlier, i.e. `nearest_neighbor()` and `get_closest()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of `nearest_neighbor()` function is to handle and transform the data from GeoDataFrame into `numpy arrays` (=super-fast data structure) in a format how `BallTree` function wants them. This includes converting the lat/lon coordinates into radians (and back), so that we get the distances between the neighboring points in a correct format: scikit-learn's [haversine distance metric](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.DistanceMetric.html) wants inputs as radians and also outputs the data as radians. To convert a lat/lon coordinate to radian, we use formula: `Radian = Degree * PI / 180`. By doing this, we are able to get the output distance information in meters (even if our coordinates are in decimal degrees). \n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_closest()` function does the actual nearest neighbor search using [BallTree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.BallTree.html) function. We initialize the `BallTree` object with the coordinate information from the **right_gdf** (i.e. the point dataset that contains all the nearest neighbor candidates), and we specify the distance metric to be `haversine` so that we get the Great Circle Distances. The `leaf_size` parameter adjusts the tradeoff between the cost of BallTree node traversal and the cost of a brute-force distance estimate. Changing leaf_size will not affect the results of a query, but can significantly impact the speed of a query and the memory required to store the constructed tree. We determine the leaf_size as 15 which has been found to be a good compromise when [benchmarked](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/04/29/benchmarking-nearest-neighbor-searches-in-python/). After we have built (initialized) the ball-tree, we run the nearest neighbor query with `tree.query(src_points, k=k_neighbors)`, where the src_points are the building-coordinates (as radians) and the `k` -parameter is the number of neighbors we want to calculate (1 in our case as we are only interested in the closest neighbor). Finally, we just re-arrange the data back into a format in which the closest point indices and distances are in separate numpy arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The functions here assume that your input points are in WGS84 projection. If you pass the points in some other projection, it is highly likely that the distances between nearest neighbors are incorrect. Determining which is the nearest neighbor should not be affected, though.  "

    "\n",
    "While using the technique from previous examples produces correct results, it is in fact quite slow from performance point of view. Especially when having large datasets (quite typical nowadays), the point in polygon queries can become frustratingly slow, which can be a nerve-racking experience for a busy geo-data scientist. \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily there is an easy and widely used solution called **spatial index** that can significantly boost the performance of your spatial queries. Various alternative techniques has been developed to boost spatial queries, but one of the most popular one and widely used is a spatial index based on [R-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree) data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind the **R-tree** is to form a tree-like data structure where nearby objects are grouped together, and their geographical extent (minimum bounding box) is inserted into the data structure (i.e. R-tree). This bounding box then represents the whole group of geometries as one level (typically called as \"page\" or \"node\") in the data structure. This process is repeated several times, which produces a tree-like structure where different levels are connected to each other. This structure makes the query times for finding a single object from the data much faster, as the algorithm does not need to travel through all geometries in the data. In the example below, we can see how the geometries have been grouped into several sub-groups (lower part of the picture) and inserted into a tree structure (upper part) where there exists two groups on the highest level (`R1` and `R2`), which are again grouped into five lower level groups (`R3-R7`):\n",
